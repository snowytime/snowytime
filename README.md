<h3 align="center">Hey there ðŸ‘‹</h3>
<p align="left">I'm a fullstack developer who loves building things. React is the best framework, but I'm having an affair with Vue ðŸ¤« I love building things, creating open source projects, and learning new neat coding things.</p>

**Open Sourcerer**
I love open source and making things that help ease peoples lives (and mine). I exclusively use github packages to manage these projects, and can be used by adding to your `.npmrc >> @snowytime:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/snowytime`

**ESM only**
I have made the move in all my projects to only support and use esm, and test all my code with ava. I feel that we should all make the change over to esm and pray to the gods that typescript, node, and ecma play nicely and fix the mess that is cjs/mjs.
